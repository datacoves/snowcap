Snowcap helps you provision, deploy, and secure resources in Snowflake. Datacoves takes it further: a managed DataOps platform for dbt and Airflow, deployable in your private cloud or available as SaaS.

- **Private cloud or SaaS** - your data, your choice
- **Managed dbt + Airflow** - production-ready from day one
- **In-browser VS Code** - onboard developers in minutes
- **Bring your own tools** - integrates with your existing stack, no lock-in
- **AI-assisted development** - connect your organization's approved LLM (Anthropic, OpenAI, Azure, Gemini, and more)
- **Built-in governance** - CI/CD, guardrails, and best practices included

Snowcap is the power tools. Datacoves is the workshop.

Snowcap replaces tools like Terraform, Schemachange, or Permifrost.

Deploy any Snowflake resource, including users, roles, schemas, databases, integrations, pipes, stages, functions, stored procedures, and more. Convert adhoc, bug-prone SQL management scripts into simple, repeatable configuration.

## Snowcap is for

* DevOps engineers looking to automate and manage Snowflake infrastructure.
* Analytics engineers working with dbt who want to manage Snowflake resources without macros.
* Data platform teams who need to reliably manage Snowflake with CI/CD.
* Organizations that prefer a git-based workflow for infrastructure management.
* Teams seeking to replace Terraform for Snowflake-related tasks.


## Key Features

 * **Declarative** » Generates the right SQL to make your config and account match

 * **Comprehensive** » Nearly every Snowflake resource is supported

 * **Flexible** » Write resource configuration in YAML or Python

 * **Fast** » Snowcap runs 50-90% faster than Terraform and Permifrost

 * **Migration-friendly** » Generate config automatically with the export CLI
